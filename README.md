## Paper abstract

In the sport of climbing and bouldering, difficulty grades are important for skill assessment, enjoyment and safety. Although there are standardized scales to minimize inconsistency, the difficulty assessment is performed by humans and sensitive to subjectivity. Therefore, we have developed a tool that predicts the difficulty grades of climbing routes using machine-learning.  
The routes are described in a semi-natural Domain-Specific Language, which can be parsed into symbol sequences. Here, a symbol represents a climbing move. The symbol sequences are then used as inputs to a variable-order Markov models (VOMMs) based classifier. With the VOMM prediction algorithm Decomposed Context Tree Weighting (DE-CTW), we trained one VOMM on _Easy_ climbing routes and one on _Hard_ climbing routes. By calculating a test route's likelihood for both VOMMs, the _average log-loss_}, we predict if a route is _Easy_ or _Hard_.  
We have implemented six predictor variations to vary with interpretation detail in the symbolization process. After using 50-fold cross validation on 146 climbing routes, our best performing variation performed slightly better than a trivial classifier. Still we believe this research's foundations are of interest for future research. We conclude with detailed explanations and proposed improvements.

## Run it

Recommended settings
- **Model depth = 5**  
Used for the VOMM learning process. This is the max length of subsequences (_context_, here: number of consecutive climbing holds/moves) considered for the probability calculation.
- **Identifier**  
Determines save location for VOMMs (`vomm/src/data/grades/<identifier>`). A program run erases the existing folder contents first, so use a new ID if you want to keep the old contents.
- **k âˆˆ {10..30}**  
A high k can take hours, but it can benefit the accuracy with this small of a dataset.
- **N <= data_size**  
A high N can take hours. Choose a N of -1 to set N to data_size.


Commands  
First run? Run `make` in [`vomm/src`](vomm/src) first.
- **k-fold cross-validation** :clock1::clock1::clock1:  
  Performs k-fold cross-validation. Classifies climbing routes in 6 variations. Outputs classifications and confusion matrices for every variation.  
  `ruby performance_kfold.rb <k> <model-depth> <id>`
- **Classify a random route** :clock1::clock1:  
  Performs N rounds of classification, taking a random climbing route as test set and all other routes as train set. Routes cannot be picked more than once. Classifies in 6 variations. Outputs classifications and confusion matrices for every variation.  
  `ruby performance_one.rb <N> <model-depth> <id>`
- **Only train on all routes** :clock1:  
  `vomm_train_all.sh`
- **Play with patterns** :zap:  
  See DE-CTW's magic of pattern recognition. Run `playground.sh` and `test.sh` in [`vomm/src`](vomm/src) for quick and simple examples. You can easily adjust the examples.

## Tweak it
For your ease of navigation, every filename in this doc is a clickable link.

- **Change grade classes**  
    Edit [`grades.rb`](grades.rb). It already contains alternative grade class distributions.
    - Separate the climbing and bouldering routes: set `MergeMode` to false.
    - Choose other distributions: assign them to
    `boulder_conversion` & `climb_conversion` (if `MergeMode` is true) or `boulder_classes` and `climb_classes` (if `MergeMode` is false).
- **Change grammar**  
    Edit [`climbing.gra`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/Grammar/climbing.gra) and parse afterwards:
    1. Copy the `climbing.gra` file right outside the Grammar folder. (A weird but necessary hack.)
    2. Run [`./run_grammar`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/run_grammar)
    3. Drag the [`base.dic`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/Grammar/base.dic) and [`simple.net`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/Grammar/simple.net) to the Grammar folder, replace the old files
    4. Parse by running `make` in [`phoenix/app/strangebeta/`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/)
- **Change symbolization**  
    1. You can alter the symbol sets by changing how symbols are made from parsed climbing routes. In [`move.rb`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/move.rb), [`resymbolize.rb`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/resymbolize.rb) and [`symbolize.rb`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/symbolize.rb) you can determine the influence of aspects like hold shape, hold size, action shape, etc.
    2. Run `make` in [`phoenix/app/strangebeta/`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/)
- **Change data (sanitation)**  
    1. Edit the input data in [`strangebeta_user_climb_data_20180128.txt`](data/strangebeta_user_climb_data_20180128.txt) and/or edit the pre-parser sanitation in [`sb_ucd_anal.rb`](data/sb_ucd_anal.rb).
    3. Run `make` in [`phoenix/app/strangebeta/`](phoenix/app/strangebeta/)
